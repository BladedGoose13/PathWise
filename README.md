## 🎯 About The Project

PathWise is a Progressive Web App designed for high school students (12-24 years old) in Mexico, especially those in public schools from low to medium-income households. The platform addresses educational inequality through an integrated ecosystem that combines:

- 🧠 **AI-powered personalized learning paths**
- 📚 **Centralized and adaptive educational resource hub**
- 🤝 **Institutionally verified hyper-local student social network**

### Problem It Solves

Mexico's upper-secondary education system shows deep inequality: many public school students have limited access to devices, weak internet, few learning resources, and often must balance school with work. PathWise centralizes open resources into clear learning routes and creates safe spaces for local collaboration.

## ✨ Key Features

- Standardized diagnostic test
- Personalized plans for scholarships, university admissions, or academic regularization
- Real-time progress tracking

### 2. Learning Hub
- Centralization of open-source educational resources
- Content in multiple formats (video, text, interactive)
- AI-generated personalized materials based on learning style

### 3. Hyper-Local Community
- Institutionally verified social network
- Collaboration on real projects: entrepreneurship, volunteering, civic initiatives
- CV and portfolio building with verifiable experiences

## 🛠 Technologies

### Frontend
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Progressive Web App (PWA)
